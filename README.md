# 🎯 QR Code Generator in Python

A simple and handy Python script to generate custom QR codes for any link or text. Built with ❤️ using `pyqrcode`, this mini project allows you to convert URLs (or any string) into a downloadable QR code image in `.png` format with just a few lines of input.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Generate QR codes from any text or link.
- Saves QR codes as `.png` files.
- Auto-randomized file naming to avoid overwrites.
- Lightweight and fast – done in seconds!

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The script asks for the filename (text only, no numbers).
2. It creates a QR code for a predefined link (`https://www.instagram.com/rehanpathan8351/`).
3. The file is saved with a random number attached to the name to make it unique.
